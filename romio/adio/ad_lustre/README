FAQ:
  Q: How do I configure the Lustre ADIO driver?
  A: Please include these options when configuring MVAPICH:
     --with-romio --with-file-system=lustre
  
  Q: What if I need to enable Lustre support along with others?
  A: You can add support for more file systems as the following:
     --with-romio --with-file-system=lustre+nfs+pvfs2
  
  Q: How do run a program using the Lustre ADIO driver?
  A: First, Please make sure you are on a Lustre file system. 
     Second, if you have enabled support for multiple file system, 
        please give a prefix "lustre:" to the name of the accessing file.
     For example:
     # mpicc -o perf romio/test/perf.c
     # bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 node01 node02 ./perf -fname lustre:testfile

  Q: My program bails out with this error:
     **io No such file or directory*?
  A: Please make sure the following conditions are true:
     -- you are running on the correct file system
     -- you have given a correct pathname for the file
     -- you have set the correct permission for the file or directory 

  Q: My program segfaults with this error: 
     File locking failed in ADIOI_Set_lock?
  A: Recent lustre releases requrie an additional mount option to have 
     correct file locks. So please insert this option into 
     your lustre mount command: "-o localflock". 
     For example:
     # mount -o localflock -t lustre xxxx@o2ib:/datafs /mnt/datafs
