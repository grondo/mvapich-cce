/*
 * PMGR_COLLECTIVE ============================================================
 * This protocol enables MPI to bootstrap itself through a series of collective
 * operations.  The collective operations are modeled after MPI collectives --
 * all tasks must call them in the same order and with consistent parameters.
 *
 * MPI may invoke any number of collectives, in any order, passing an arbitrary
 * amount of data.  All message sizes are specified in bytes.
 * PMGR_COLLECTIVE ============================================================
 *
 * This file defines the interface used by the MPI tasks (clients).
 *
 * An MPI task should make calls in the following sequenece:
 *
 *   pmgr_init
 *   pmgr_open
 *   [collectives]
 *   pmgr_close
 *   pmgr_finalize
 *
 * MPI may invoke any number of collectives, in any order, passing an arbitrary
 * amount of data.  All message sizes are specified in bytes.
 *
 * All functions return PMGR_SUCCESS on successful completion.
