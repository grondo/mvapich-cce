This directory contains the unified Nexus/P4/MPICH secure server.

Merge to do list:

* Make stand alone--not dependant on p4 or Nexus (autoconf)

There are already some additional things to do:

* The logfile code should cap the size of the logfile, occasionally 
truncating it (or shortening it or keeping one backup version).

* We need programs to talk to the server (for things like %exit and %id).
