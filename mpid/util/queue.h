#ifndef _MPID_QUEUE

/*
   This file contains the datastructures for managing the queues of 
   posted receives and of unexpected messages.  

   These are collected together because a common operation is

     search unexpected queue for matching message; if not found, add to
     posted receive queue.

   In a multi-threaded environment, this needs to be "thread-atomic"; thus we
   combine these together.  This also simplifies the implementation of
   this operation.

   Because of the importance of this queue, we've added explicit support
   for MPI.  This is indicated by the fields:
   context_id
   tag, tagmask
   lsrc, srcmask

   (note that the last two may depart if we split the queues by source).
   The mask fields allow us to replace

   itag == tag || tag == MPI_ANY_TAG

   with 

   (itag & tagmask) == tag

   saving us a compare and branch at the cost of a load and bitwise-and.
   Generalizations of the tagmask could provide users with additional
   functionality (for MPICH EXTENSIONS).

   We use a singly linked list, since we have always just searched the list at
   the time when we delete something, so don't need random deletion.  (This
   saves space in the QEL and time in maintaining unnecessary back pointers).
   The queue header has a pointer to the first element in the queue, and a
   pointer to the pointer to the last element (this avoids an emptiness test
   when inserting).  

   In a multithreaded environment, we may want to make the following elements
   *volatile*:
   struct _MPID_QEL *next
   MPID_QEL *first
   MPID_QEL **lastp;

 * and the completion routines. 
 * Normally this code is compiled in, but is only executed under control

 * when not being debugged.
 * For extra optimisation even this can be removed under control of an
 * ifdef. (See sendq.h).

 * we just search the queue to find the one we need at the point when	
 * we're removing it.
