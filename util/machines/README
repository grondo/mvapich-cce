This directory contains a list of the machines at Argonne.  You will need to 
provide your own line.  The format is one machine per line; the file names
are "machines.$ARCH".

It is acceptable for there to be repetitions, or even for all lines to be
the same.  It the latter case, all processes will be started on the same
machine, but the processes will still communicate via sockets.
