Graphical Visualization Tools for Parallel Programs   
<H2>Description</H2>
Jumpshots are graphical tools for understanding the performance of parallel
programs.  They are evolved from <TT>upshot</TT> and are written in Java.  There are
2 versions of Jumpshots, <TT>Jumpshot-2</TT> and <TT>Jumpshot-3</TT>, distributed with MPE.
<TT>Jumpshot-2</TT> interprets CLOG tracefiles and <TT>Jumpshot-3</TT> interprets SLOG
tracefiles which is capable of handle big tracefiles (in GB range).

<H2>Configuring &amp; Building Jumpshots</H2>
Since Jumpshots are distributed with MPE, the top level MPE configure
will configure both version of Jumpshots by default.  Through the use
of configure option <TT>--with-java=&lt;JDK&gt;</TT> in MPE configure, user can supply
a user installed java installation to MPE to build both version of
Jumpshots.  Even though <TT>Jumpshot-3</TT> can be built by both JDK 1.1 and
JDK 1.2, <TT>Jumpshot-2</TT> can only be built with JDK 1.1.  Because of this
limitation, user is advised to use JDK 1.1 when building Jumpshots
for MPE.  However user can build <TT>Jumpshot-2</TT> and <TT>Jumpshot-3</TT> separately
from MPE with different versions of JDK.  If user chooses to do
that, be sure to install them back to the final install directory
share/, otherwise the logviewer script won't work properly.
A list of configure options is available by typing <TT>./configure --help</TT> in the
top-level <TT>jumpshot-2</TT> and <TT>jumpshot-3</TT> directories.
<P>
For detailed information on building <TT>Jumpshot-2</TT>, refer to the README
in the top-level <TT>jumpshot-2</TT> source directory at mpe/viewers/jumpshot-2.
<P>
For details information on building <TT>Jumpshot-3</TT>, refer to the README
and UserGuide.txt in the top-level <TT>jumpshot-3</TT> directory at
mpe/viewers/jumpshot-3.
<P>
<P>
<H2>Usage</H2>
Both versions of Jumpshots are installed in the final install directory,
share/.  End-users are not expected to call jumpshots directly, instead
there is a display program selector script called <TT>logviewer</TT> located
in bin/.  This script will select the appropriate viewer based on
the logfile's file extension, ie. log file format.  For more information
about logviewer, do "logviewer -help".
<P>
For more details on the button definitions in <TT>Jumpshot-2</TT>, click the
<TT>help</TT> button on Jumpshot-2's main window to bring up the ASCII
version of button definitions.
<P>
For <TT>Jumpshot-3</TT>, besides the ASCII version of button definitions
available by clicking in the main window's <TT>help</TT> -&gt; <TT>Manual</TT> buttons,
there is also a HTML viewer which displays a step-by-step tour of
Jumpshot-3 of how and what user can learn from a typical logfile.  The
HTML tour can be invoked by clicking the main window's <TT>help</TT>-&gt;<TT>Tour
</TT>buttons.  New users of Jumpshots are advised to read the <TT>Tour</TT> document.
<P>
<P>
<H2>Additional Information</H2>
<TT>Jumpshot-3</TT> is written based on <TT>Jumpshot-2</TT> but contains many enhanced new
features not found in Jumpshot-2, and also contains a lot more graphic
bugs fixed.  So users are advised to use Jumpshot-3 whenever possible.
