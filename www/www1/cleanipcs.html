Removes System V IPCs held by the user 
<H2>Description</H2>
This command frees the shared memory segments and semaphores help by
the user that calls this command.  This command is normally not
needed, but if MPI programs exit abnormally, the program may be unable
to free the System V IPCs that it held (this is a feature of System V
IPCs).  In that case, cleanipcs can be used to recover the IPCs that
are no longer needed.
<P>
Note that this command releases <EM>all</EM> IPCs held by the user.  This is
the correct behavior for most users, but may cause problems for users
of other programs or systems that rely on the persistence of System V
IPCs.
