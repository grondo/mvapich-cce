<PRE>
        mem     - Enable dynamic memory tracing of internal MPI objects

                  the specified rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD.  A rank of -1
                 selects all of MPI_COMM_WORLD.

        trace   - Trace routine calls

<P>
<H2>Notes</H2>
Note that the Fortran binding for this routine has only the error return
argument (<TT>MPI_INIT(ierror)</TT>)
<P>
Because the Fortran and C versions of <TT><A HREF="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node151.html#node151">MPI_Init</A></TT> are different, there is
a restriction on who can call <TT><A HREF="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node151.html#node151">MPI_Init</A></TT>.  The version (Fortran or C) must
match the main program.  That is, if the main program is in C, then
the C version of <TT><A HREF="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node151.html#node151">MPI_Init</A></TT> must be called.  If the main program is in
Fortran, the Fortran version must be called.
<P>
On exit from this routine, all processes will have a copy of the argument
list.  This is <EM>not required</EM> by the MPI standard, and truely portable codes
should not rely on it.  This is provided as a service by this
implementation (an MPI implementation is allowed to distribute the
command line arguments but is not required to).
<P>
Command line arguments are not provided to Fortran programs.  More
precisely, non-standard Fortran routines such as getarg and iargc
have undefined behavior in MPI and in this implementation.
<P>
The MPI standard does not say what a program can do before an <TT>MPI_INIT</TT> or
after an <TT>MPI_FINALIZE</TT>.  In the MPICH implementation, you should do
as little as possible.  In particular, avoid anything that changes the
external state of the program, such as opening files, reading standard
input or writing to standard output.
<P>
<H2>Signals used</H2>
The MPI standard requires that all signals used be documented.  The MPICH
implementation itself uses no signals, but some of the software that MPICH
relies on may use some signals.  The list below is partial and should
be independantly checked if you (and any package that you use) depend
on particular signals.
<P>
<H2>IBM POE/MPL for SP2</H2>
SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, SIGTERM,
SIGIO
<P>
<H2>-mpedbg switch</H2>
SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, SIGSYS
<P>
<H2>Meiko CS2</H2>
SIGUSR2
<P>
<H2>ch_p4 device</H2>
SIGUSR1
<P>
The ch_p4 device also catches SIGINT, SIGFPE, SIGBUS, and SIGSEGV; this
helps the p4 device (and MPICH) more gracefully abort a failed program.
<P>
<H2>Intel Paragon (ch_nx and nx device)</H2>
SIGUSR2
<P>
<H2>Shared Memory (ch_shmem device)</H2>
SIGCHLD
<P>
Note that if you are using software that needs the same signals, you may
find that there is no way to use that software with the MPI implementation.
The signals that cause the most trouble for applications include
<TT>SIGIO</TT>, <TT>SIGALRM</TT>, and <TT>SIGPIPE</TT>.  For example, using <TT>SIGIO</TT> and
<TT>SIGPIPE</TT> may prevent X11 routines from working.
<P>
<H2>Errors</H2>
<P>
All MPI routines (except <TT><A HREF="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node150.html#node150">MPI_Wtime</A></TT> and <TT><A HREF="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node150.html#node150">MPI_Wtick</A></TT>) return an error value;
C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last
argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler
may be changed with <TT><A HREF="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node148.html#node148">MPI_Errhandler_set</A></TT>; the predefined error handler
<TT>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</TT> may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does <EM>not</EM> guarentee that an MPI program can continue past
an error.
<P>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_SUCCESS </B> <DD> No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_OTHER </B> <DD> This error class is associated with an error code that 
indicates that an attempt was made to call <TT>MPI_INIT</TT> a second time.
<TT>MPI_INIT</TT> may only be called once in a program.
