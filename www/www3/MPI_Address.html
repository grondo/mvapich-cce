Gets the address of a location in memory   
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
#include "mpi.h"
int MPI_Address( void *location, MPI_Aint *address)
</PRE>
<H2>Input Parameters</H2>
<DL><DT><B>location </B> <DD> location in caller memory (choice) 
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Output Parameter</H2>
<DL><DT><B>address </B> <DD> address of location (integer) 
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Note</H2>
This routine is provided for both the Fortran and C programmers.
On many systems, the address returned by this routine will be the same
as produced by the C <TT>&amp;</TT> operator, but this is not required in C and
may not be true of systems with word- rather than byte-oriented
instructions or systems with segmented address spaces.
<P>
<H2>Notes for Fortran</H2>
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <TT>MPI_WTIME</TT> and <TT>MPI_WTICK</TT>) have
an additional argument <TT>ierr</TT> at the end of the argument list.  <TT>ierr
</TT>is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
<TT>call</TT> statement.
<P>
All MPI objects (e.g., <TT>MPI_Datatype</TT>, <TT>MPI_Comm</TT>) are of type <TT>INTEGER
</TT>in Fortran.
