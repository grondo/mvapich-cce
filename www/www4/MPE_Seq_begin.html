<H2>Notes</H2>
<TT>MPE_Seq_begin</TT> and <TT>MPE_Seq_end</TT> provide a way to force a section of code
to
be executed by the processes in rank order.  Typically, this is done
with
<PRE>
  MPE_Seq_begin( comm, 1 );
  &lt;code to be executed sequentially&gt;
  MPE_Seq_end( comm, 1 );
</PRE>

Often, the sequential code contains output statements (e.g., <TT>printf</TT>) to
be executed.  Note that you may need to flush the I/O buffers before
calling <TT>MPE_Seq_end</TT>; also note that some systems do not propagate I/O in
any
order to the controling terminal (in other words, even if you flush the
output, you may not get the data in the order that you want).
