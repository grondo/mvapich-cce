MultiProcessing Environment 
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Multi-Processing Environment (MPE) attempts to provide programmers with
a complete suite of performance analysis tools for their MPI programs based
on post processing approach.  These tools include a set of profiling libraries,
a set of utility programs, and a set of graphical visualization tools.
<P>
The first set of tools to be used with user MPI programs is profiling libraries
which provide a collection of routines that create log files.  These log files
can be created manually by inserting MPE calls in the MPI program, or
automatically by linking with the appropriate MPE libraries, or by combining
the above two methods.  Currently, the MPE offers the following 3 profiling
libraries.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>Tracing Library </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
This traces all MPI calls.  Each MPI call is preceded by a line that 
contains the rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD of the calling process, and
followed by another line indicating that the call has completed.  
Most send and receive routines also indicate the values of count, tag,
and partner (destination for sends, source for receives).  Output 
is to standard output.
<BR></TD></TR>
<P>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>Animation Library </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
This is a simple form of real-time program animation and requires X 
window routines.  
<BR></TD></TR>
<P>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>Logging Library </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
This is the most useful and widely used profiling libraries in MPE. 
They form the basis to generate log files from user MPI programs.
There are currently 3 different log file formats allowed in MPE.  
The default log file format is CLOG.  It is basically a collection 
of events with single timestamps.  And there is ALOG which is provided 
for backward compatibility reason and it is not being developed.  And 
the most powerful one is SLOG, stands for Scalable LOGfile format, 
which can be converted from CLOG after CLOG file has been generated 
(preferred approach), or can be generated directly when MPI program 
is executed (through setting the environmental variable MPE_LOG_FORMAT
to SLOG).
<BR></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The set of utility programs in MPE includes log format converter (e.g.
clog2slog), logfile print (e.g. slog_print) and logfile viewer wrappers,
logviewer, which selects the correct graphical tool to display the logfile
based on the logfile's file extension.
<P>
Currently, MPE's graphical tools includes 3 display programs, upshot for
ALOG, jumpshot-2 for CLOG and jumpshot-3 for SLOG.  The logviewer script
eliminates the need for user to remember the relationship of logfile formats
to display programs.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Configuration and Installation</H2>
<P>
MPE can be configured and installed as an extension to most MPI standard
compliant MPI implementations, e.g. MPICH, LAM, SGI's MPI, HP-UX's MPI
and IBM's MPI.  It has been integrated seamlessly into MPICH distribution,
so MPE will be installed automatically during MPICH's installation process.
<P>
For details of configuring and building of MPE, please refer to the
README file in the MPE source directory.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Example MPE Programs</H2>
<P>
As previously noted, the <TT>mpe</TT> library is composed of 3 different profiling
libraries.  Each MPI implementation requires a slightly different way in which
to link with these libraries.  During configure, the link path and appropriate
libraries are determined and assigned to variables.  These variables are
first substituted in the Makefile in the directory <TT>mpe/contrib/test</TT>.  The
Makefile is then installed into directory <TT>share/examples</TT> during the final
installation process.  The following is a list of these variables.
<P>
<BR>LOG_LIBS   =  link path needed to link with the logging library
<P>
<BR>TRACE_LIBS =  link path needed to link with the tracing library
<P>
<BR>ANIM_LIBS  =  link path needed to link with the animation library
<P>
The variable FLIB_PATH is the link path needed to link fortran MPI programs
with the logging library.
<P>
During make, small test programs cpi.c and fpi.f will be linked with
each of the above libraries.  In the output from Make, a message will be
written regarding the success of each attempted link test.  The success
of these linkage tests will also be included in the Make output.  If the
linkage tests are successful, then these library link paths can be used
for your programs as well.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Customizing Logfiles</H2>
<P>
In addition to using the predefined MPE logging libraries to log all MPI
calls, MPE logging calls can be inserted into user's MPI program to define
and log states.  These states are called User-Defined states.  States may
be nested, allowing one to define a state describing a user routine that
contains several MPI calls, and display both the user-defined state and
the MPI operations contained within it.
<P>
The routine <TT>MPE_Log_get_event_number()</TT> has to be used to get unique
event numbers (this is important if you are writing a library that uses
the MPE logging routines) from the MPE system.  The routines
<TT>MPE_Describe_state()</TT> and <TT>MPE_Log_event()</TT> are then used to describe
user-defined states.
<P>
<PRE>
int eventID_begin, eventID_end;
...
eventID_begin = MPE_Log_get_event_number();
eventID_end   = MPE_Log_get_event_number();
...
MPE_Describe_state( eventID_begin, eventID_end, "Amult", "bluegreen" );
...
MyAmult( Matrix m, Vector v )
{
    /* Log the start event along with the size of the matrix */
    MPE_Log_event( eventID_begin, m-&gt;n, (char *)0 );
    ... Amult code, including MPI calls ...
    MPE_Log_event( eventID_end, 0, (char *)0 );
}
</PRE>

<P>
The log file generated by this code will have the MPI routines within the
routine MyAmult() indicated by a containing bluegreen rectangle.
<P>
If the MPE logging library, liblmpe.a, are NOT linked with the user program,
<TT>MPE_Init_log()</TT> and <TT>MPE_Finish_log()</TT> need to be used before and after all
the MPE calls.   Sample programs cpilog.c and fpi.f are available in MPE
source directory contrib/test or the installed directory share/examples to
illustrate the use of these MPE routines.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Environmental Variables</H2>
<P>
There are 2 environmental variables, <TT>TMPDIR</TT> and <TT>MPE_LOG_FORMAT</TT>, that user
<H2>may need to set before the generation of logfiles </H2>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>MPE_LOG_FORMAT </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
determines the format of the logfile generated from the
execution of application linked with MPE logging libraries.
The allowed value for <TT>MPE_LOG_FORMAT</TT> are CLOG, SLOG and
ALOG. When MPE_LOG_FORMAT is NOT set, CLOG is assumed.
<BR></TD></TR>
<P>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>TMPDIR </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
specifies a directory to be used as temporary storage for each
process.  By default, when <TT>TMPDIR</TT> is NOT set, /tmp will be used.
When user needs to generate a very large logfile for long-running
MPI job, user needs to make sure that <TT>TMPDIR</TT> is big enough to
hold the temporary logfile which will be deleted if the
merged logfile can be created successfully.  In order to
minimize the overhead of the logging to the MPI program, it is
highly recommended user to use a *local* file system for <TT>TMPDIR</TT>.
<BR></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Note : The final merged logfile will be written back to the
file system where process 0 is.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Utility Programs</H2>
<P>
In bin/, user can find several useful utility programs when manipulating
logfiles.  These includes log format converters, e.g. clog2slog, log format
print programs, e.g. slog_print, and a script to launch display program,
logviewer.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Log Format Converters</H2>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>clog2slog </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
a CLOG to SLOG logfile converter.  Since the automatic generation
of SLOG file through setting of environmental variable
<TT>MPE_LOG_FORMAT</TT> to SLOG may NOT work for some non well-behaved
MPI programs, using the logfile format converter can generate
extra diagnostic information about the condition of the logfile.
Also the converter allows one to adjust certain parameters of
the logfile, like frame size which is the segment of the logfile
to be displayed by Jumpshot-3's time line window.  For non
well behaved MPI program, one may need to increase the frame
size from the default 64KB to a bigger value.  For more
information about the converter, do "clog2slog -h"
<BR></TD></TR>
<P>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>clog2alog </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
a CLOG to ALOG logfile converter.  It is not being developed.
It is provided here for backward compatibility purpose.
<BR></TD></TR></TABLE>

<H2>Log Format Print Programs</H2>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>slog_print </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
a stdout print program for SLOG file.  It serves to check the
content of the logfile.  If the SLOG file is too big, it may
NOT be useful to use slog_print.  Also, when slog is NOT complete,
slog_print won't work.  So it serves as a simple test to check
if the SLOG file is generated completely.
<BR></TD></TR>
<P>
<TR><TD WIDTH=20></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>clog_print </B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
stdout print program for CLOG file.
<BR></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>Display Program Selector</H2>
<P>
<DL><DT><B>logviewer </B> <DD> 
the script which involves appropriate viewer based on the file
extension of logfile.  For instance, if the logfile is foo.slog,
logviewer will invoke jumpshot-3 to display the logfile.
Jumpshot-3 resides in share/.  For more information of
logviewer, do "logviewer -help" to list all available options.
