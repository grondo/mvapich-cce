move a log record from one of the input buffers to the output

<PRE>
void CLOG_cput( ptr )
double **ptr;
</PRE>
This function moves records from one of the three buffers being merged into
the output buffer.  When the output buffer is filled, it is sent to the
parent.  A separate output routine handles output on the root.  If the input
buffer is emptied (endblock record is read) and corresponds to a child, a new
buffer is received from the child.  When an endlog record is read on the input
buffer, the number of sources is decremented and the time is set to positive
infinity so that the empty input source will never have the lowest time.
<P>
At entry we assume that *p is pointing to a log record that is not an
end-of-block record, and that outbuf is pointing to a buffer that has
room in it for the record.  We ensure that these conditions are met on
exit as well, by sending (or writing, if we are the root) and receiving
blocks as necessary.
