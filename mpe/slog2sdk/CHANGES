This is SLOG-2 Standard Development Kit 

This version also contains a prototype Jumpshot, and sample implementation
of TRACE-API in trace_sample/

5/6/03 added Join method support in Jumpshot for AIX's UTE converted
       slog2 file, so disconnected bebit states can be connected in
       connected view as 1 state.

5/6/03 added an extra filter in traceTOslog2 and clogTOslog2 to remove
       unused categories

6/9/03 fixed some bugs related to the Join method.

6/9/03 modified slog2print so it is scalable.  It used to be slog2print
       read in the whole logfile recursively, this requires huge amount
       of memory.  The updated slog2print uses a new iterator to read in
       the logfile in a more scalable fashion.

6/9/03 added OverlapRatios PREVIEW_STATE_DISPLAY view and
       removed the DecreLegend view.  Added CumulativeExclusion tag
       but it is not implemented yet.

6/9/03 duplicate the control on PREVIEW_STATE_DISPLAY inside the Timeline
       window.  It is an active control.

6/23/03 replace the name for OverlapRatios by OverlapInclusionRatio, i.e.
        the original ratio stored in Preview state is renamed as InclusionRatio.

6/23/03 added the support of ExclusionRatio in the logfile format reader
        as well all traceTOslog2 convertor.

6/23/03 added the support of statistics collecton defined by the duration.
        The statistics is computed for both InclusionRatio and ExclusiveRatio.
        The statistics will be sent to the stdout for now.
        
6/23/03 updated the popup menu of the legend name in the Legend window.
        The new sort menu should be more intuitive. 

8/15/03 added a zoomable window to display statistics collected by
        right dragging a duration.

9/9/03  added a GUI logfile convertor to convert non-slog2 file.  The 
        supported logfile formats for the logfile convertor are clog and rlog.

10/1/03 added a jumpshot launcher.  It is mainly designed with MS windows user
        in mind.  The launcher will launch jumpshot with some better option
        than JVM's standard options.  User can modify those options in 
        $HOME/.jumpshot_launcher.conf

10/19/03 force jumpshot launcher to use javaw.exe instead of java.exe to launch
         jumpshot.

11/1/03  added more forgiving features in logfile convertors.  The new features
         will allow logfile to be viewable by jumpshot even when the
         corresponding category is undefined.  In that case, the category is
         assumed to be a State category with name UnknownType-INDEX where INDEX
         is the category index that defines the drawable.
